# Metronomio
## The Quality-of-Life Extension for Musicians That Nobody Asked for

## What is this?

This Firefox extension offers a few options of sites that provide free metronomes on the web. Users can select their preference and Metronomio will open the page in a new tab in the browser. No more excuses that you can't practice with a metronome because you don't have one - it's just a click away!

## How do I use it?

Click the button and find out! If you have installed Metronomio and it is not appearing next to the Firefox awesomebar, right click the normal Add-ons area at the top of the browser and select configure.

## How do I install it?

* Clone this repo or download it as a zip and unpack it.
* Open a new tab and go to 'about:debugging'
* Click 'Load Temporary Add-On', then select any file in the project folder.

This seems suspicious because it is! If you're even reading this, you are truly lost in Github.
